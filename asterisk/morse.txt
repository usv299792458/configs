LABELED ALPHANUMERICALLY, UP TO SEVEN CHARACTERS, INSTEAD OF A FREQUENCYDISPLAY.
OTHER FEATURES WORTH NOTING ARE AN AUTO DIALER WITH NINE DTMFMEMORIES AND A VOX FUNCTION.
THE PROGRAM SCAN FUNCTION ALLOWS FOR UP TOTHREE PROGRAMMABLE SCANNING RANGES.
THERES A SOMEWHAT ANNOYING ALERTFUNCTION THAT TRANSMITS ALTERNATING DTMF TONES FOR 5 SECONDS.

SOFTWARE WHILE ALINCO OFFERSFREE DJ V57 CLONE UTILITY SOFTWARE FIGURE 1 FOR DOWNLOAD FROM THEIRWEBSITE, THE OPTIONAL ERW 7 USB PROGRAMMING CABLE AND EDS 10 ADAPTER MUSTBE PURCHASED.
A SERIAL CABLE IS ALSO AVAILABLE.
THE SOFTWARE INSTALLATIONIS SIMPLE ENOUGH, BUT I RECOMMEND THE USER CAREFULLY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.I FOUND THE SOFTWARE TO BE UNSOPHISTICATED AND NOT INTUITIVE.
PACKS ON MY OTHER HANDHELDS.
EVEN MY ROCK BOTTOM, LOST IN THE QUARRY RADIOHAD A HIGHER BATTERY CAPACITY.
ALINCO DOES OFFER A 2000 MAH NIMH BATTERYPACK FOR ABOUT 50, AND IT WORKS WITH THE SUPPLIED WALL CHARGER.
ACCORDINGTO THE MANUAL, IT TAKES ABOUT 30 HOURS TO CHARGE, SO THE OPTIONAL EDC 159RAPID CHARGER WILL BE OF INTEREST.
TWO HIGH CAPACITY LI ION BATTERY PACKSARE ALSO AVAILABLE, BUT THEY REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL CHARGER.
THEOPTIONAL EBP 64 1600 MAH LI ION BATTERY PACK AND THE MATCHING EDC 160 RAPIDCHARGER ADD ABOUT 100 TO THE COST OF THIS TRANSCEIVER.
FOR THOSE ON THEOTHER SIDE OF THE POND, AN 1100 MAH LI ION BATTERY PACK IS A STANDARDFEATURE WITH THE DJ V57E EUROPEAN VERSION.
MANUAL PROGRAMMING OF MEMORIES200, PLUS A CALL CHANNEL IS VERY SIMPLE.
AFTER DIALING IN THE FREQUENCYAND OPERATING PARAMETERS IN THE VFO MODE, THERE ARE ONLY FOUR STEPS TOCOMPLETE THE PROGRAMMING OF A MEMORY CHANNEL.
